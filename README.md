# Superstore Sales Analysis 📊
**Academic Project | University of Minho | Data Science Degree**

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data from a global Superstore to extract business insights. The main goal was to compare how different database systems handle analytical queries regarding profit, customer behavior, and logistics.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Database Models
I implemented the same data domain across three different architectures:
* **Relational (MySQL):** Focused on structured data and complex joins.
* **NoSQL (Cassandra):** Optimized for high-volume data and specific query performance.
* **Graph (Neo4j):** Used to map relationships between customers, orders, and products.

## 💼 Key Business Questions Answered
Using SQL, CQL, and Cypher, I solved 5 core business problems:
* **Profitability:** Identified products that were selling well but losing money.
* **Customer Loyalty:** Segmented top-tier customers for marketing actions.
* **Logistics:** Found patterns in shipping locations to optimize distribution.
* **Seasonality:** Analyzed which months drive the most profit per category.

## 📂 Repository Contents
